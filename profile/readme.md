# Who Are We?
Geometry Dash is a game known for its user-made levels, and for good reason. They drive the game's popularity and have sustained it for years. However, no community-run repository for how to make good levels exists. The "[GJGuide](http://www.boomlings.com/files/GJGuide.pdf)" PDF, while officially endorsed by Robtop, is outdated and doesn't have nearly enough info you'd need to create a good level.

That's where we come in. **Our goal is to serve as an up-to-date, community-made encyclopedia containing everything you need to know as a creator.** While our job isn't complete yet, we're constantly adding new lessons to the server so we can help as many creators as possible.
